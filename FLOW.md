# GitHub Actions CI/CD Flow Architecture

This document explains the complete flow of how the `go-sample-app` gets built, containerized, and deployed using the modular `platform-github-actions` repository, self-hosted runners, and local Kubernetes cluster.

## Overview

The architecture consists of four main components:
1. **go-sample-app** - The Go application with Helm charts
2. **platform-github-actions** - Reusable workflow templates and actions
3. **Self-hosted GitHub Actions Runner** - Executes the workflows locally
4. **Local Kubernetes Cluster** - Target deployment environment

## Key Technical Details

### Image Tagging Strategy
- **Format**: `feature-summary-YYYYMMDD.{run_number}`
- **Example**: `feature-summary-20250616.89`
- **Registry**: `ghcr.io/osru-leu/go-sample-app/go-sample-app:tag`

### Architecture Compatibility
- **Build Target**: `GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64`
- **Runner**: macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
- **Container**: ARM64 compatible
- **Kubernetes**: Local cluster on ARM64

### Health Check Configuration
- **Endpoint**: `/health`
- **Response**: `{"service":"calculator","status":"healthy"}`
- **Probes**: Both liveness and readiness use `/health`

### Service Configuration
- **Type**: NodePort
- **Port Mapping**: 80 ‚Üí 8080
- **Access**: `kubectl port-forward service/go-sample-app 8080:80`

## Security-First Pipeline Flow

```mermaid
graph TB
    SETUP[setup] --> LINT[lint]
    LINT --> TEST[test]
    TEST --> BUILD[build]
    BUILD --> PACKAGE[docker-build-push - build only]
    SETUP --> PACKAGE
    PACKAGE --> SECURITY[security scan]
    SECURITY --> PUSH[push-to-registry]
    PUSH --> DEPLOY[deploy-k8s]
    
    subgraph "üõ°Ô∏è SECURE PROCESS"
        PACKAGE -.->|"Build image locally<br/>NO push yet"| LOCAL[Local Docker Image]
        SECURITY -.->|"Scan local image<br/>BEFORE publishing"| SCAN[Security Scan Results]
        PUSH -.->|"Push ONLY if<br/>security scan passes"| GHCR[GitHub Container Registry]
    end
    
    style PACKAGE fill:#e8f5e8
    style SECURITY fill:#e8f5e8
    style PUSH fill:#e8f5e8
```

### Security Benefits
- **üîí Build First**: Images are built locally without immediate publication
- **üõ°Ô∏è Scan Before Push**: Security scans run on local images before registry push
- **‚úÖ Conditional Push**: Only security-approved images reach the container registry
- **üö´ Fail Fast**: Pipeline stops if vulnerabilities are detected, preventing publication

## Workflow Triggers and Conditions

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    START[Workflow Trigger] --> PUSH_CHECK{Push to branch?}
    START --> DISPATCH_CHECK{Manual dispatch?}
    
    PUSH_CHECK -->|Yes| BUILD_ONLY["Build, Scan & Push Image<br/>No Deployment"]
    DISPATCH_CHECK -->|Yes + Deploy K8s checked| FULL_DEPLOY["Build, Scan, Push & Deploy"]
    DISPATCH_CHECK -->|Yes + Deploy K8s unchecked| BUILD_ONLY
    
    BUILD_ONLY --> STEPS1["‚Ä¢ Lint<br/>‚Ä¢ Test<br/>‚Ä¢ Build<br/>‚Ä¢ Docker Build (local)<br/>‚Ä¢ Security Scan<br/>‚Ä¢ Push to Registry"]
    FULL_DEPLOY --> STEPS2["‚Ä¢ Lint<br/>‚Ä¢ Test<br/>‚Ä¢ Build<br/>‚Ä¢ Docker Build (local)<br/>‚Ä¢ Security Scan<br/>‚Ä¢ Push to Registry<br/>‚Ä¢ Deploy to K8s"]
    
    STEPS1 --> END1[Secure Image in GHCR]
    STEPS2 --> END2[Running Secure App in K8s]
```

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Helm Conflict Resolution
```bash
# Automatic cleanup of stuck operations
if helm list -n default --pending --failed | grep -q go-sample-app; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Found stuck Helm operation, cleaning up..."
  helm uninstall go-sample-app -n default || true
  sleep 5
fi
```

### Authentication
- **GHCR**: Uses `${{ github.token }}` for authentication
- **Kubernetes**: Uses `ghcr-secret` for image pulls
- **Self-hosted**: Runner has direct cluster access

## Monitoring and Observability

### Pipeline Visibility
- **GitHub Actions UI**: Real-time job progress
- **Step Summaries**: Deployment details and status
- **Artifacts**: Test coverage, security reports
- **Container Registry**: Image versions and metadata

### Application Monitoring
- **Health Endpoint**: `/health` for status checks
- **Web Interface**: `http://localhost:8080` for testing
- **API Endpoints**: REST API for calculator operations
- **Kubernetes**: Pod status, service endpoints, logs

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Modularity**: Reusable actions across multiple projects
2. **Consistency**: Standardized build and deployment patterns
3. **Local Development**: Self-hosted runner with direct cluster access
4. **Security-First**: Images scanned before publication, fail-fast on vulnerabilities
5. **Flexibility**: Manual deployment control with automatic builds
6. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and status reporting
7. **ARM64 Native**: Optimized for Apple Silicon with Rancher Desktop integration
8. **Composite Actions**: Cross-platform compatibility without containerized action limitations

## Security Enhancements

This pipeline implements **security-first DevSecOps practices**:

- **üîí Local Build**: Images built locally before any publication
- **üõ°Ô∏è Pre-Publication Scanning**: Security analysis runs before registry push
- **‚úÖ Conditional Publishing**: Only vulnerability-free images reach the registry
- **üö´ Fail-Fast**: Pipeline stops immediately if security issues are found
- **üìä Security Reporting**: Detailed vulnerability reports in GitHub Security tab
- **üîÑ Automated Updates**: Security patches can trigger rebuilds

This architecture provides a robust, scalable, and **secure** foundation for Go application development and deployment while maintaining developer productivity and operational reliability.

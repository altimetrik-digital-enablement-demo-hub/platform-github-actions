# Package Node Project

This GitHub Action packages a Node.js project using a custom packaging command (e.g., `npm pack`) and uploads the resulting artifact.  
It's useful in workflows for packaging and distributing Node.js applications or libraries.

## Description

This action:
- Runs a custom packaging command (default: `npm pack`)
- Captures the output package filename
- Uploads the packaged file as a GitHub Actions artifact

## Usage

```yaml
uses: amorattabalt/platform-github-actions/.github/actions/common/github-actions/git-package@main
with:
  package-command: 'npm pack'
  artifact-name: 'my-node-package'
  package-output-dir: '.'
```

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - uses: amorattabalt/platform-github-actions/.github/actions/common/github-actions/git-package@main
        with:
          package-command: 'npm pack'
          artifact-name: 'my-node-app'

- The packaging command output must print the final package file path as the last line of output.
- Common use cases include `npm pack`, `zip -r`, or custom CLI packaging tools.
